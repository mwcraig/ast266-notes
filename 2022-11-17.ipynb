    "+ *flux* is what a telescope measures -- the amount of light (or energy) per unit area per second. \n",
    "    - Note, though, that it takes careful calibration to convert the counts in an image to a flux in units of energy per second per unit area.\n",
    "    - In many cases this coinversion can be avoided, fortunately.\n",
    "+ *Luminosity* is the amount of energy per second a light source, like a star emits.\n",
    "+ A Hertzsprung-Russel diagram plots the relationship between *luminosity* and *temperature*, though *color* is often used as an indirect measurement of temperature.\n",
    "\n",
    "The relationship between flux, which is $f$ in the equation below, and luminosity, which is $L$ in the equation below, captures what you know from everyday experience: the further away a light is, the dimmer it appears. If we call the distance from the observer/telescope to the light source (say a star) $d$ then the flux-luminosity relationship  is\n",

    "f = \\frac{L}{4\\pi d^2}.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a nice geometric interpretation of this: the luminsoty $L$ of the star spreads out over a sphere of radius $d$ as it travels through space. The area of a sphere is $4\\pi d^2$, so the relationship above is luminosty divided by area, which is flux.\n",
    "\n",
    "This relationship  is called the *inverse square law*. There are exceptions to it, the most common of which in every day life is a laser. A laser is designed to send all of its light in one direction. Because the light does not spread out (or at least does not spread out quickly) its flux-luminosity relationship  is different.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are astronomical sources in which radiation is \"beamed\" instead of spreading out uniformly in all directions. One example is a pulasre, a rapidly spoinng neutron star.. Another is a quasr, which is the core of a galaxy whose central black hole is consuming large amounts of gas, primarily emitting radiation in two directions."
